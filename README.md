# Simple TaskTracker App

This is a TaskTracker application - a digital tool that helps users organize and manage their tasks, reminders, and activities. The main purpose is to keep track of things that need to be done by due dates making it easier to stay organized and productive.

## Functionality

- Task Creation: Users can add tasks with simple titles like "Buy groceries" or more detailed descriptions.

- Due Dates & Reminders: Tasks can be given specific due dates or deadlines.

- Checkboxes/Completion Tracking: Once a task is completed, it can be marked off with a simple checkbox or completion button. This gives a sense of accomplishment.

- Delete: Task that are accomplished can be deleted from the task list

## Technology

- HTML: Defines the structure of the web page (e.g., creating buttons, input fields, task lists).

- CSS: Handles the styling of the app (e.g., colors, fonts, layout, animations).

- JavaScript (JS): Makes the app interactive and handles logic like adding tasks, marking tasks as complete, and  
  deleting tasks
- OOP: Object-Oriented Programming to structure our TaskTracker app. We used:
  . Classes:They encapsulate data and behavior related to a particular entity. We had to create two classes FormValidator and Todo class.
  . Objects: Instances of a class. They hold actual data (properties) and the actions (methods) that can be performed on that data
  . Encapsulation: Grouping related data and methods together in one object.
  . Inheritance: Creating a new class based on an existing one, inheriting its properties and methods.
- JavaScript modules: that allow us to break our code into separate files, each containing different pieces of functionality.
